# bpsync

Roadmap:
- Correct threading for SongWorker and integration with progress bar dialog
- Fix database calls (global engine + entry appending instead of overwriting, etc.)
- Main menu
- Set up standard sync

Extras:
- Context menu displaying all available libpytunes fields
- Arbitrary volume adjustment context menu directly editing underlying `Song` object
- Statistics calculations for checked items in table
